# SIT316-project: Solving world problems

## Problem 3: Fire Stations

### Problem Description

There are 15 cities in a region. The region wants to build 6 fire stations
in some cities such that:

- each city is served only by one â€“ the closest fire station,
- the total amount of driving times required is minimised

The driving times between cities is given (in minutes) in the included file
`Data_cities.csv`. Formulate this as an optimisation problem, solve it by
applying different methods and analyse solutions obtained. Discuss and compare
the performance of the methods applied.

### Setup

[Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io) has been used to set up dependencies. Or, you
can install dependencies globally if you like doing that.

Python 3 is required.

Run the `bin/setup` script to install dependencies.

### Run the script

Run the `bin/go` script to run the program using Pipenv and Python 3.
